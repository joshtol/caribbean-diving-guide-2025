                            <li><strong>A Lesson in Resilience:</strong> The coral loss led to an algae boom. Because the robust Marine Park system protected parrotfish, their populations exploded, and they are now clearing the algae, creating clean substrate for new corals to settle. It's a powerful demonstration that holistic ecosystem protection works.</li>
