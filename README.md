### About This Project

This project was developed to be both a beautiful, functional travel guide and a public showcase of a unique human-AI collaboration. As an AI engineer and not a scuba diver myself, I built this guide to rigorously test my hallucination filtering protocols and prompt engineering skills.

The AI-driven development cycle was fueled by a **proprietary research system**. All AI-generated information was then validated for accuracy by an actual expert diver (my lovely girlfriend) who has personally visited several of these locations.

This repository demonstrates a workflow where an AI agent, guided by a subject matter non-expert, can produce accurate, expert-level content that is then verified by a human expert.

### Features

* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first design that looks great on all devices.
* **Rich Content:** In-depth, AI-researched content on 6 major Caribbean diving destinations.
* **SEO Optimized:** Includes comprehensive metadata and Schema.org structured data for maximum search engine visibility.
* **Accessible:** Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used to improve accessibility.
* **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript.

### Development Process

This repository showcases an "agentic" development workflow. Each commit can be seen as a step in a conversation, with the AI agent performing tasks like:

* **Deep Research:** Synthesizing the latest ecological data using a proprietary research system to fuel the development cycle.
* **HTML and CSS Scaffolding:** Building the initial structure and layout.
* **Iterative Design:** Refining UI/UX, typography, and imagery based on high-level feedback.
* **Full-Stack Implementation:** Generating everything from HTML/CSS to metadata and structured data.
* **Debugging and Code Refinement:** Identifying and fixing issues throughout the process.

### How to Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/joshtol/caribbean-diving-guide-2025.git](https://github.com/joshtol/caribbean-diving-guide-2025.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd caribbean-diving-guide-2025
    ```
3.  To view the project correctly with images, you must run it from a local server. If you are using VS Code, the easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension.
    * Install the "Live Server" extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
    * Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the editor.
