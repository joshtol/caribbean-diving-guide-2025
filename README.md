### About This Project

This project was developed to be both a beautiful, functional travel guide and a public showcase of the power of human-AI collaboration in web development. The entire application, from initial research and content generation to design, coding, and SEO optimization, was built through a series of iterative prompts and refinements with an AI agent.

The guide provides a comprehensive look at the top diving destinations in the Caribbean, with a special focus on the ecological challenges facing the region's coral reefs in 2025 and the conservation efforts underway to protect them.

### Features

* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first design that looks great on all devices.
* **Rich Content:** In-depth, AI-researched content on 6 major Caribbean diving destinations.
* **SEO Optimized:** Includes comprehensive metadata and Schema.org structured data for maximum search engine visibility.
* **Accessible:** Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used to improve accessibility.
* **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript.

### Development Process

This repository showcases an "agentic" development workflow. Each commit can be seen as a step in a conversation, with the AI agent performing tasks like:

* Initial research and content writing.
* HTML and CSS scaffolding.
* Iterative design changes based on feedback (fonts, layout, imagery).
* Advanced optimization for SEO and accessibility.
* Debugging and code refinement.
